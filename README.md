#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves creating of reliable ,scalable softwares useful to various fields to make life easier.
Importance
-Drives Innovation
-Promotes teamwork through collaborations
-ensures high quality softwares
-scalable softwares able to support increasing user demand are created
-integration of more secure systems to curb cyber threats


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a)The Birth of Software Engineering
The term software engineering was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This marked the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline rather than an ad-hoc programming activity.
The conference addressed the "Software Crisis", a period when software projects frequently ran over budget, exceeded deadlines, and failed to meet quality expectations.
This milestone led to the development of structured programming, software lifecycle models, and formal methodologies to improve software reliability and maintainability.
b)The Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by introducing the concept of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Languages like Smalltalk (1972), C++ (1983), and later Java (1995) adopted OOP principles, making software more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
OOP played a significant role in modern software engineering, influencing software design patterns and architectural practices.
c)The Rise of Agile Methodologies 
In response to the rigid and slow processes of traditional Waterfall development, Agile Software Development emerged in the late 1990s and was formalized in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto.
Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements and deliver software faster.
This milestone led to widespread adoption of Agile frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps, which have transformed the way software is developed, tested, and deployed in modern industries.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.Planning – Defines project scope, goals, resources, and feasibility to ensure a clear roadmap for development.

2.Requirements Analysis – Gathers and documents user and system requirements to understand what the software must accomplish.

3.Design – Creates system architecture, database structures, and user interfaces, outlining how the software will function.

4.Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code based on design specifications, turning concepts into a working system.

5.Testing – Identifies and fixes bugs through unit, integration, and system testing to ensure the software meets quality standards.

6.Deployment – Releases the software for use, either in a test environment (beta) or for full production.

7.Maintenance – Provides ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and enhancements to keep the software functional and up-to-date.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1.Approach
Waterfall
-Sequential, structured process.
Agile
-Iterative, flexible process.
2.Phases
Waterfall
-Defined upfront; each phase is completed before moving to the next.
Agile
-Continuous development with iterative cycles (sprints).
3.Flexibility
Waterfall
-Rigid; difficult to accommodate changes.
Agile
-Highly adaptable to changing requirements.
4.Customer Involvement
Waterfall
-Minimal involvement after requirements phase.
Agile
-Continuous customer feedback and collaboration.
5.Delivery
Waterfall
-Full product delivered at the end.
Agile
-Incremental releases with frequent updates.
6.Testing
Waterfall
-Performed after development is complete.
Agile
-Ongoing testing throughout development.
Examples.

-->Waterfall – Best for Predictable, Well-Defined Projects
Example 1- Banking Systems – Requires strict compliance, detailed documentation, and minimal changes.
Example 2-Construction Management Software – Clear requirements and regulatory constraints make a structured approach ideal.
-->Agile – Best for Dynamic, Evolving Projects
Example 1- Mobile App Development – Frequent updates, user feedback, and feature iterations are needed.
Example 2-E-commerce Websites – Continuous improvements based on customer trends and market demands.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer

Writes, tests, and maintains code based on project requirements.
Implements software features and fixes bugs.
Collaborates with designers, QA engineers, and other team members.
Optimizes code for performance and scalability.
Documents code and technical specifications.

2.Quality Assuarace Engineer

Designs and executes test cases to identify software defects.
Ensures the software meets quality and performance standards.
Automates testing processes where applicable.
Works with developers to resolve bugs and improve software reliability.
Verifies compliance with security and usability requirements.

3.Project Manager
Defines project scope, goals, and deliverables.
Coordinates tasks among team members and ensures deadlines are met.
Manages risks, budgets, and resource allocation.
Communicates project progress with stakeholders.
Ensures the team follows the chosen development methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall).

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1.Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Importance:
-Provides code editing, debugging, and compiling tools in one platform.
-Enhances productivity with features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection.
-Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks.

Example-->
-Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Lightweight, supports multiple extensions.
-IntelliJ IDEA – Popular for Java development with intelligent code assistance.

2.Version Control Systems (VCS)
Importance:
-Tracks changes in code, enabling collaboration and rollback if needed.
-Prevents code conflicts in team environments.
-Facilitates continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
Examples-->
-Git – Widely used, supports distributed version control.
-GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket – Platforms for hosting and managing Git repositories.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 1.Debugging and Fixing Bugs
Challenge: Identifying and resolving complex software bugs.
Strategy: Use debugging tools, log analysis, and unit testing to isolate and fix issues efficiently.
2. Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technologies
Challenge: New programming languages, frameworks, and tools emerge frequently.
Strategy: Continuous learning through online courses, tech blogs, and community engagement.
3. Managing Tight Deadlines
Challenge: Pressure to deliver projects quickly without compromising quality.
Strategy: Use Agile methodologies, prioritize tasks, and improve time management.
4. Handling Complex Codebases
Challenge: Large, unorganized codebases make development difficult.

Strategy: Follow Agile practices, maintain flexible code architecture, and communicate with stakeholders regularly.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit Testing
Definition: Tests individual components (functions, classes, or modules) in isolation.
Importance: Detects early bugs, ensures each unit functions correctly before integration.
Example: Testing a login function separately before integrating it with the authentication system.
2. Integration Testing
Definition: Verifies interactions between integrated components or modules.
Importance: Ensures seamless communication between different software parts.
Example: Checking if the login module correctly interacts with the database.
3. System Testing
Definition: Tests the complete system as a whole to validate its functionality.
Importance: Confirms that the entire application meets requirements and works as expected.
Example: Running a test on an e-commerce website to ensure all features (cart, checkout, payment) function properly.
4. Acceptance Testing
Definition: Determines if the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
Importance: Validates software from the end-user perspective before release.
Example: A client tests a newly developed mobile app to ensure it meets their needs before launch.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
